  <h1>About Meet Me at UMMA</h1>
  <p>Meet Me at UMMA is a multi-sensory arts based program for individuals living with dementia. In 2008, a group of passionate UMMA docents and volunteers decided to create their own version of the <a href="https://www.moma.org/visit/accessibility/meetme/"> Meet Me at MOMA project</a> In this program, trained docents provide interactive gallery tours for individuals living with dementia and their loved ones.</p>

  <p>In 2017, the program received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to expand their available services. This grant has helped to further develop a collaborative learning partnership with guests in which docent volunteers integrate new research and methods into their practices.</p>

  <p>The Meet Me tours include visual art, storytelling, music and more to offer engaging and enjoyable museum experiences for people living with memory loss and their families and care partners.</p>
