    <p>TimeSlips is a creative storytelling method developed by Anne Bastings (www.timeslips.org). Meet Me docents attended a talk and workshop presented by Anne Bastings, creator of Timeslips, in January. Here, they learned methods to incorporate storytelling into their monthly tours. Check back for updates as the group begins to implement the TimeSlips program!</p>
